### Task:
Create iOS application which shows user's books lists.

Main app screen should show a list of user's books lists in a vertical scroll. Each list should shows up to 5 books in a horizontal scroll. Tapping button "ALL" should show a screen with all the books of that list in a vertical scroll. Tapping a book should show that particular book's details screen.

### Requirements:
- Each screen should have a way to to refresh content.
- Application must support at least three latest iOS versions.
- Errors should be handled and information should be shown to the user.

### Wireframes:

### APIs:
- Books: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/edmundas/assignment/books
- Book details: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/edmundas/assignment/book/{book_id}
- Lists: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/edmundas/assignment/lists

### Bonus tasks:
- Store data in database and refresh from API.
- Cover code with unit tests.

### Notes:
- Provided wireframes meet functional requirements, but UI/UX can be improved.
- Standard iOS UI components used within Apple HIG is enough.
- Code structure and user experience is more important than visuals.
- Prioritize Apple frameworks against third party options.
